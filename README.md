The program allows you to adjust the frequency and the amplitude of the noise function.
There is a possibility to regulate the octaves as well.

`R` - Refresh with a new seed\
`UP` - Increase the amplitude by 0.02\
`DOWN` - Decrease the amplitude by 0.02\
`RIGHT` - Increase the frequency by 0.02\
`LEFT` - Decrease the frequency by 0.02\
`-_` - Increment the amount of octaves\
`+=` - Decrement the amount of octaves
